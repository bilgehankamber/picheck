@@@{"notifyid":"2023.03.18","message":"How Pi Check notifications work.?\n\nPi Check notifications do not work by sending messages to your device like notifications on your computer and phone.\nPi Check application periodically checks the file at https://github.com/muratyurdakul75/picheck/blob/main/Notify/Nofity.txt. If there is a new message in this file, it will show you.\nIn short, no message is sent to your IP address from anywhere, on the contrary, Pi Check application receives the message from github site.","expdate":"2050.01.01","countrylist":""}@@@
