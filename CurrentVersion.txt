@@@What's new~r~n~r~n1. A detailed list display has been added when clicking on the amount of RAM used by applications.~r~n2. Changed the screen title to read "Runing" when in autorun mode~r~n3. In order not to create too much load, RAM usage amounts will be calculated at 5 minute intervals instead of 1 minute. (There is no workload in the total RAM calculation. For this reason, it will continue to be updated at intervals of 6-7 seconds.)4. Total RAM information has been added to the widget page.@@@
