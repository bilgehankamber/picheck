You can change the RAM warning limit for Docker, Pi Node and WSL. You can make this setting from the window that opens when you click on the relevant fields.\n3. New additions have been made to the Docker page. You can see how many CPUs the Docker application is using, how long it has been running, or Docker statistic information (CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Disk R/W, Network I/O).\n4. A chart of the first 10 countries has been added to the Connections page.\n5. Fixed the issue where performance drops as the number of Uniq IPs on the Connections page increases."}@@@
