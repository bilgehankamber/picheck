What's new...

1. Added Power Plan feature. With this update, you can now use different Windows power plans according to the time interval you specify. Your computer will run in Balanced Power mode during the day and automatically switch to High performance mode at night. Or you can do the opposite. Or you can automatically switch your computer to Low power mode when there is a power outage. You can activate this feature from the Settings page.
2. Block counts on the homepage now update in real time.
3. Fixed an issue where the Pi Node file path used in Crash Checking was not automatically found.
