PiCheck 16 will be released on Saturday, August 31st. With this update, you can now use different Windows power plans based on the time interval you specify. Your computer will run in Balanced Power mode during the day and automatically switch to High performance mode at night. Or you can do the opposite. Or you can automatically switch your computer to Low power mode when the power goes out. It all depends on how you want to manage it. PiCheck is now even smarter with Docker and PiNode crash checks coming with PiCheck 15 and Windows Power Plan checks coming with PiCheck 16.
